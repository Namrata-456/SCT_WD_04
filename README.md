# Task 04 - To-Do Web App
This is Task 04 from my internship at Skill Craft Technology (SCT). In this task, I created a simple yet functional To-Do Web App that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently.

## Features
Add Tasks: Users can easily add new tasks.

Edit Tasks: Tasks can be edited for easy modifications.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks that are no longer needed.

Mark Tasks as Complete: Users can mark tasks as complete.

Set Date/Time: Each task can have a due date and time for better tracking.

## Technologies Used
HTML for structure.

CSS for styling.

JavaScript for functionality (task management, user interactions).
